# Structural improvements 


What we have done to improve the structure of our code by:

## Decomposition
- We decomposed our code by creating different modules for individual tasks that are coherent with the main file to run the program
- Within each module further code decomposition was achieved through the use of multiple functions and one class (number might increase in the future) 

Why we did it: 
Decomposing our project made it easier to work independently on subproblems, which reduced the number of merge conflicts and the stress resulting from those :sweat_smile:. Furthermore, code decomposition helped to structure the code and keep it better organized.

## Abstraction
- We used functions to hide details the user doesn't need to know and wrote docstrings in case someone would like to get some basic information about a particular function

Why we did it:
The user shouldn't have to care about the internal implementation details and the interaction with the program should only occur over the user interface. Ideally, the program will run without issues in a user-friendly way.
