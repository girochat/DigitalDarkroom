# 1. Welcome to the Roadmap!

Never knew how to read a roadmap?? No worry, this one doesn't require a good sense of orientation... :wink:  
Our project is to create a Photo Album Organizer <!-- to be refined -->, a simple tool with image storing, organizing and editing functionality. On this page you'll find all the relevant information you need to get a first impression of the project, what milestones we have set for ourselves, how well on our way we are at achieving them and how you might get involved.


# 2. Willing to participate?

### Project management 
Timeframe: April 27

- define our mission, goals and the scope of the project
- structre the project into milestones and break those further down into smaller tasks

### Task 1: Image Upload and Organization 
Timeframe: May 4
 - Prepare repository on GitHub
     - decide how to structure the repository (main, branches...)
     - agree on how to work collaboratively on same branch
 - Allow users to upload and store images in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
     - decide how images are stored in dependencies (main folder, folder per event/date?)
     - handle case where images are uploaded via folder or many files
     - upload via CLI ? -> many choices available to the user
     - list necessary dependencies in a file
 - Organize images into event folders.
     - create Image class
     - user can call Images by event but also by dates or locations
     - diaporama or panaroma preview of the images in an event folder

### Task 2: Basic Image Editing 
Timeframe: May 11

- Enable users to perform basic image editing tasks via input to the terminal.
    - ameliorate user interface : dynamic interface
    - select image to be edited directly from panorama or diaporama view
    - choose editing options : adjust brightness/contrast, image enhancement
- Provide a preview of the edited image before saving the changes.
    - ask for confirmation before saving changes
    - provide a preview 
    - allow for duplicate image with edited feature
- Input via terminal 
    - update dependencies file

### Task 3: Image Metadata and Analysis 
Timeframe: May 18

- Allow users to view and edit metadata associated with their images. 
    - allow the user to add geo-data to images or events
    - offer to the user to edit the name and location (all attributes of class Image) of an image and an event folder
    - add option to delete event folders or images


- Provide visualizations and analysis of image metadata.
    - visualise map of image locations
    - plot density maps for the image locations


- Implement Unit tests :white_check_mark:



### Minimum viable project 
Timeframe: May 25
- Virtual environment



### Presentation 
Timeframe: June 1

The day we have all been waiting for - or so :sweat_smile:

Task:
- Stay calm
- Try to articulate and speak loud enough
- Celebrate :clinking_glasses:
