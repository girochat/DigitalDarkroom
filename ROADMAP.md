# 1. Welcome to the Roadmap!

Never knew how to read a roadmap?? No worry, this one doesn't require a good sense of orientation... :wink:  
Our project is to create a Photo Album Organizer <!-- to be refined -->, a simple tool with image storing, organizing and editing functionality. On this page you'll find all the relevant information you need to get a first impression of the project, what milestones we have set for ourselves, how well on our way we are at achieving them and how you might get involved.


# 2. Willing to participate?

# 3. Timeline :hourglass_flowing_sand:

In the following section you'll find a brief overview of our milestones with a rough timeframe, what tasks we are currently working on and what the next steps will be.

<!--Those points should be described:
- Project status goals (feature release, minimum viable project)
- Dates / Events (Presentations, Release, Exams, etc)
- Timeframes (short, medium, long term)-->

## Milestones
<!--
Include for each task:
- What needs to be done

### Project management 
Timeframe: April 27

- define our mission, goals and the scope of the project
- structre the project into milestones and break those further down into smaller tasks


<details>
<summary>Discuss: <!--only for us - was testing out features, sorry :smiley: --></summary>

- [ ] How does our project best meet its objective?
- [ ] Creating clean and effective code:
    - clear logic and dependencies;
    - clean organization of files and folders
- [ ] Which functions should go into which modules?
- [ ] How do our data flow through the project?
- [ ] Which functions can be grouped together, or isolated?

</details>



### Task 1: Image Upload and Organization 
Timeframe: May 4
 - Prepare repository on GitHub
     - decide how to structure the repository (main, branches...)
     - agree on how to work collaboratively on same branch
 - Allow users to upload and store images in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
     - decide how images are stored in dependencies (main folder, folder per event/date?)
     - handle case where images are uploaded via folder or many files
     - upload via CLI ? -> many choices available to the user
     - list necessary dependencies in a file
 - Organize images into albums or categories, such as by date, event, location or subject.
     - create Image class
     - create Album class
     - user can call Images by Album but also by dates or locations

### Task 2: Basic Image Editing 
Timeframe: May 11

- Enable users to perform basic image editing tasks via input to the terminal. 
    - choose editing options : crop, face detector, labeling, BW filter (sepia? more?), adjust brightness/contrast, similarity dectector
    - ameliorate user interface : dynamic interface   
- Provide a preview of the edited image before saving the changes.
    - ask for confirmation before saving changes
    - provide a preview
    - allow for duplicate image with edited feature
- Input via terminal -> argparse module?
    - update dependencies file

### Task 3: Image Metadata and Analysis 
Timeframe: May 18

- Allow users to view and edit metadata associated with their images, such as date, location, and camera settings. 
    - offer to the user to edit the label, date, location (all attributes of class Image) of an image.
    - offer to the user the possibility to merge or divide event/album
    - add geo-data for where the image was taken

- Provide visualizations and analysis of image metadata, such as the distribution of images by date or location, or histograms of camera settings (e.g., aperture, shutter speed).
    - visualise map of image locations
    - visualise distribution of images that have faces, that have been edited...

- Implement Unit tests :white_check_mark:



### Minimum viable project 
Timeframe: May 25
- Virtual environment
- What does success look like?



### Presentation 
Timeframe: June 1

The day we have all been waiting for - or so :sweat_smile:

Task:
- Stay calm
- Try to articulate and speak loud enough
- Celebrate the end :clinking_glasses:
